# Demystifying Democratization: A Comparative Analysis of IT Skill Requirements in Low-Code Development Platforms

**Abstract:** Low-code development platforms (LCDPs) promise to democratize application development by enabling citizen developers with minimal coding experience to build functional applications. This paper presents a comparative analysis of several LCDPs, focusing on the level of IT skills required for successful application creation within each platform. The analysis explores the specific IT technologies utilized by each LCDP and how these technologies impact the level of technical expertise needed for development. By comparing the platforms' functionalities and underlying technologies, this study aims to identify LCDPs that offer the most user-friendly development experience with the least reliance on extensive IT knowledge. This research provides valuable insights for both citizen developers seeking accessible platforms and organizations evaluating LCDPs for streamlining their application development processes.


The data (CSV) describes the following aspects of each low-code development platform:

* Requirements documentation
    * Workflow model
    * Database model
    * UI model
    * Validations
    * Application logic
  
* Design and development
    * Workflow design and development
    * Database design
    * Fetching data
    * GUI design and development
    * Data validation development
    * Actions design and development
    * Programming

* Implementation
    * Runtime server installation
    * Database installation
    * Client module installation
    * Deployment
    * Version control

Each platform has its own strengths and weaknesses in terms of the keywords listed in the "Keywords - IT skills required" column. For example, Mendix requires familiarity with Java, JavaScript, SQL/OQL, and relational databases, while Zoho Creator requires familiarity with Scripts (Deluge) and HTML.

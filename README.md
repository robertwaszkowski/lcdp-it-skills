# Demystifying Democratization: A Comparative Analysis of IT Skill Requirements in Low-Code Development Platforms

**Abstract:** Low-code development platforms (LCDPs) promise to democratize application development by enabling citizen developers with minimal coding experience to build functional applications. This paper presents a comparative analysis of several LCDPs, focusing on the level of IT skills required for successful application creation within each platform. The analysis explores the specific IT technologies utilized by each LCDP and how these technologies impact the level of technical expertise needed for development. By comparing the platforms' functionalities and underlying technologies, this study aims to identify LCDPs that offer the most user-friendly development experience with the least reliance on extensive IT knowledge. This research provides valuable insights for both citizen developers seeking accessible platforms and organizations evaluating LCDPs for streamlining their application development processes.


The data (CSV) describes the following aspects of each low-code development platform:

* Requirements documentation
    * Workflow model
    * Database model
    * UI model
    * Validations
    * Application logic
  
* Design and development
    * Workflow design and development
    * Database design
    * Fetching data
    * GUI design and development
    * Data validation development
    * Actions design and development
    * Programming

* Implementation
    * Runtime server installation
    * Database installation
    * Client module installation
    * Deployment
    * Version control

Each platform has its own strengths and weaknesses in terms of the keywords listed in the "Keywords - IT skills required" column. For example, Mendix requires familiarity with Java, JavaScript, SQL/OQL, and relational databases, while Zoho Creator requires familiarity with Scripts (Deluge) and HTML.

The table above highlights the intersection of business and IT skills required for low-code development platforms.  Traditionally, software development has demanded a strong IT background  with skills like Java, SQL, and database management.

However, low-code platforms are designed to bridge this gap by offering solutions that empower  business users  with limited coding experience to contribute to application development. These solutions are often marked with a "+" sign in the table to indicate they are features that can be utilized by those without a strong IT background.

For instance, under Zoho Creator's "UI model" section, we see "+ Screen templates / Zoho - Pre-built Apps". This signifies that Zoho Creator offers pre-built templates and components that business users can leverage to design the user interface  without needing to code from scratch.

Similarly, under  Mendix's "Fetching data" section, there's no "+" sign. This suggests that data fetching in Mendix might require more technical knowledge, perhaps involving SQL queries.

In essence, the "+" sign highlights functionalities within the platform that cater to business users with minimal coding experience.
